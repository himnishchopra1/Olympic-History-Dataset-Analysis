For my project, I analyzed a dataset on the modern Olympic Games available on Kaggle. The dataset covers all the Games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016 and can be found at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results. In my analysis, I conducted various queries to gain insights and discoveries about different aspects of the Olympics. Here are some examples of the topics I explored:

- How many Olympic Games have been held?
- What are the details of each Olympics game held so far?
- What is the total number of nations who participated in each Olympic game?
- Which year saw the highest and lowest number of countries participating in the Olympics?
- Which nation has participated in all of the Olympic Games?
- What is the sport which was played in all summer Olympics?
- Which sports were played only once in the Olympics?
- What is the total number of sports played in each Olympic game?
- Who are the oldest athletes to win a gold medal?
- What is the ratio of male and female athletes who participated in all Olympic Games?
- Who are the top 5 athletes who have won the most gold medals?
- Who are the top 5 athletes who have won the most medals (gold/silver/bronze)?
- What are the top 5 most successful countries in the Olympics? Success is defined by the number of medals won.
- What are the total gold, silver, and bronze medals won by each country?
- What are the total gold, silver, and bronze medals won by each country corresponding to each Olympic game?

Through these queries, I used data analysis techniques to gain a deeper understanding of the historical record of the Olympics.
